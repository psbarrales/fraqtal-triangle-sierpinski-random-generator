### [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle)

The **Sierpinski triangle**, also called the **Sierpinski gasket** or the **Sierpinski Sieve**, is a **fractal** and **attractive fixed set** with the overall _shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles_. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of _self-similar_ sets, i.e., it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction.
